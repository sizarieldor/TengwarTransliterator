Transliterate English text into Tengwar

A Java algorithm that converts text written in the Latin alphabet into text written in Tengwar (Mode of Beleriand). 
The algorithm is set up for the English language and is slightly different from the official Mode of Beleriand, based on my own experience.

The code returns a jumble of characters. To see it as Tengwar, install the Tengwar Annatar font (https://www.dafont.com/tengwar-annatar.font, the basic version is in the repo) and paste the output in something like MS Word, where you can then change the font to Tengwar Annatar. 

Ennyn Durin aran Moria pedo mellon a minno
im Narvi hain echant Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw chin
